Overview
This project involves creating a Node.js Express application integrated with Firebase Firestore to handle form submissions and store data in the Firestore database. The application includes a user-friendly HTML form that collects user input and validates it before sending the data to the server. Upon successful submission, the data is stored in Firestore, and the user receives feedback about the status of their submission.

Approach
Project Initialization and Setup:

Node.js Project Initialization: We started by initializing a new Node.js project and installing the necessary dependencies such as express, firebase-admin, and body-parser.
Project Structure: We created a well-organized project structure to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.
Firebase Firestore Integration:

Firebase Project Setup: A new Firebase project was created, and Firestore was configured within it.
Service Account Configuration: A service account key was generated and integrated into the Node.js project to authenticate and interact with Firestore.
Firestore Configuration: A separate configuration file (firebase.js) was created to initialize and export the Firestore instance for use in the application.
HTML Form Creation:

Form Structure: An HTML form was created with fields for the user's name, email, and message. The form includes basic validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly.
Client-Side Script: A script was added to handle form submission via AJAX, providing a seamless user experience without page reloads.
Form Submission Handling:

Express Route Setup: A dedicated route (form.js) was created to handle POST requests from the form submission.
Data Validation and Storage: The server validates the incoming data and stores it in Firestore, adding a timestamp for each entry.
Feedback and Error Handling:

User Feedback: The application provides feedback to the user upon successful submission or in case of errors.
Error Handling: Proper error handling and logging mechanisms are implemented to capture and address any issues during form submission or data storage.
Deployment:

Deployment Platforms: Instructions were provided for deploying the application to popular cloud platforms such as Heroku, Vercel, and Firebase Hosting.
